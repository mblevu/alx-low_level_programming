0x15 file io

An ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file is a standard file format used for executables, shared libraries, and core dumps in Unix-like operating systems. It consists of a header followed by a series of sections containing various types of data.

The ELF header is located at the start of the file and contains information about the file itself, such as its format, architecture, and entry point. The information displayed by the program includes:

Magic: A sequence of bytes that identifies the file as an ELF file.
Class: Whether the file is 32-bit or 64-bit.
Data: The endianness of the file.
Version: The version of the ELF format used by the file.
OS/ABI: The operating system and ABI (Application Binary Interface) used by the file.
ABI Version: The version of the ABI used by the file.
Type: The type of the file (e.g., executable, shared object, core dump).
Entry point address: The memory address where execution should start when the file is executed.
